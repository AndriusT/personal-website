abstract: Chameleon gravity is an example of a model that gives rise to
  interesting phenomenology on cosmological scales while simultaneously
  possessing a screening mechanism, allowing it to avoid solar system
  constraints. Such models result in non-linear field equations, which can be
  solved analytically only in simple highly symmetric systems. In this work we
  study the equation of motion of a scalar-tensor theory with chameleon
  screening using the finite element method. More specifically, we solve the
  field equation for spherical and triaxial NFW cluster-sized halos. This allows
  a detailed investigation of the relationship between the NFW concentration and
  the virial mass parameters and the magnitude of the chameleon acceleration, as
  measured at the virial radius. In addition, we investigate the effects on the
  chameleon acceleration due to halo triaxiality. We focus on the parameter
  space regions that are still allowed by the observational constraints. We find
  that given our dataset, the largest allowed value for the chameleon-to-NFW
  acceleration ratio at the virial radius is $\sim 10^{âˆ’7}$. This result
  strongly indicates that the chameleon models that are still allowed by the
  observational constraints would not lead to any measurable effects on galaxy
  cluster scales. Nonetheless, we also find that there is a direct relationship
  between the NFW potential and the chameleon-to-NFW acceleration ratio at the
  virial radius. Similarly, there is a direct (yet a much more complicated)
  relationship between the NFW concentration, the virial mass and the
  acceleration ratios at the virial radius. Finally, we find that triaxiality
  introduces extra directional effects on the acceleration measurements. These
  effects in combination could potentially be used in future observational
  searches for fifth forces.
