abstract: Verlinde's theory of Emergent Gravity (EG) describes gravity as an
  emergent phenomenon rather than a fundamental force. Applying this reasoning
  in de Sitter space leads to gravity behaving differently on galaxy and galaxy
  cluster scales; this excess gravity might offer an alternative to dark matter.
  Here we test these ideas using the data from the Coma cluster and from 58
  stacked galaxy clusters. The X-ray surface brightness measurements of the
  clusters at 0.1 < z < 1.2 along with the weak lensing data are used to test
  the theory. We find that the simultaneous EG fits of the X-ray and weak
  lensing datasets are significantly worse than those provided by General
  Relativity (with cold dark matter). For the Coma cluster, the predictions from
  Emergent Gravity and General Relativity agree in the range of 250 - 700 kpc,
  while at around 1 Mpc scales, EG total mass predictions are larger by a factor
  of 2. For the cluster stack the predictions are only in good agreement at
  around the 1 - 2 Mpc scales, while for râ‰³10 Mpc EG is in strong tension with
  the data. According to the Bayesian information criterion analysis, GR is
  preferred in all tested datasets; however, we also discuss possible
  modifications of EG that greatly relax the tension with the data.
