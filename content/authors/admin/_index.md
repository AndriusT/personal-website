I'm a postdoc at the University of Nottingham where I do research on cosmological tests of modified gravity. I have a broad set of interests that include (but are not limited to) theories of gravity, using galaxy clusters to constrain models of gravity, applying machine learning to cosmology (and pretty much anything else). 

I have recently finished my PhD at the University of Portsmouth where I studied models of modified gravity and how to constrain them using galaxy clusters and other astrophysical data. 

Before that I have studied for an MPhys degree at the University of Edinburgh. My master's thesis focused on the double-field inflationary model known as hybrid inflation.
