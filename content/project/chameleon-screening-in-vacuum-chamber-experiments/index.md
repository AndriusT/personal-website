Modified gravity theories such as the chameleon and the symmetron are described by non-linear equations of motion, which generally cannot be solved analytically for arbitrary density distributions. In this project we tackle this problem by employing a numerical technique known as the finite element method (FEM). This powerful approach allows us to model modified gravity effects in a variety of contexts. For instance, the equations can be solved numerically to model vacuum chamber experiments that look for evidence of a chameleon fifth force. Similarly, complicated modified gravity effects in astrophysical systems, such as cosmic voids and galaxy clusters, can also be modelled. The produced numerical results can then act as a powerful tool for designing future experimental and observational searches for modified gravity.

Chameleon gravity can be described by the following action:

$$S = \int \mathrm{d}x^{4}\sqrt{-g}\bigg(\frac{M_{Pl}^{2}}{2} R$$
