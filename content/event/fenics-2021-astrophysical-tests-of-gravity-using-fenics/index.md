title: "FEniCS 2021: Astrophysical Tests of Gravity Using FEniCS"
abstract: "A talk given in the FEniCS 2021 conference, on applying FEniCS/DOLFIN
  to solve the field equation in chameleon gravity. Using FEniCS allows one to
  solve the non-linear chameleon equation of motion for sources of arbitrary
  complexity. In this case we apply FEniCS to solve the chameleon equations for
  the NFW density distributions of galaxy clusters. "
